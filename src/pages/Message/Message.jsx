            feel my gratitude for years of us being together. I am so grateful to
            God that he gave me the woman who will I share and spent my time on
            this world. A woman who truly understand me in anyway possible. A
            woman who supports me with my dreams and passion. A woman who guides
            me to become a better person and a woman who stick with me through ups
            and downs. I owe your parents a lot because without their existence I
            wouldn't met the love of my life. I thank you for being my best
